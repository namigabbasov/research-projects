# **Predicting Peace Agreement Success with LLMs**

![Peace with LLMs Banner](peacewithLLMs.png)

## **Overview**  
This project undertakes an ambitious goal of predicting the sucess/failure of peace agreements based on their text and their document metadata. It investigates the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in conflict and peace studies, focusing on three primary areas: text classification, text similarity, and predictive modeling. By analyzing unstructured text from the Peace Agreements Database and the UN General Debate speeches, the study aims to uncover factors that contribute to the success or failure of peace agreements.

## **Key Objectives**  
1. **Peace Agreement Classification**:  
   - Leverage LLMs like BERT and T5 to classify peace agreements by success or failure, using labels from the UCDP Peace Agreement Dataset.
2. **Predictive Modeling**:  
   - Analyze predictive performance of various explanations for success or failure of peace agreements.
3. **Textual Similarity Analysis**:  
   - Examine alignment or divergence in UN General Debate speeches to determine their predictive value for peace agreement outcomes.

## **Methodology**  
- **Datasets**:  
  - **Peace Agreements Database**: Primary source of unstructured text from peace agreements.
  - **UCDP Peace Agreement Dataset**: Provides success/failure data for agreements.
  - **UN General Debate Speeches**: Analyze for text similarity to assess alignment/divergence.  

- **Models and Tools**:  
  - **LLMs**: BERT, T5, and others for text classification and similarity analysis.  
  - **Text Analysis**: fine-tuning LLMs from Hugging Face

## **Work in Progress**  
- **Status**:  
  - This research is a work in progress and findings are not available yet.  
  - The research was presented at the CWC on LLMs and GenAI at Southern Political Science Association conference.  

- **Next Steps**:  
  - Conduct detailed text analysis using Python.  
  - Integrate results into a working paper for submission.  
  - Add Python codes and other replication files to this repository once all analyses are completed.
